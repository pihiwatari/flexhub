Flexhub is a couple of auxiliary tools created with Vue.js to aid in the day-to-day activities of the Additive Manufacturing team.

These include:

### Instant quoting tool (Digifabster).

A third-party, iframe embedded quoting tool used for internal 3D printing parts requests from other departments. Just upload any supported 3D model file, and get your quote (Restricted to Flex employees only!).

### Flex AM enabled laboratories.

A leaflet map displaying all the Flex AM laboratories around the globe. It also links to internal presentation files with the lab's AM capabilities.

### Breakeven point - Injection Molding vs 3D printing calculator.

Calculate how many parts would require your project before switching to Injection molding solutions. Just input your 3d model pricing and injection molding data from your supplier and get your breakeven point
